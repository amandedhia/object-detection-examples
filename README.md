# object-detection-examples
Object detection small example projects using only OpenCV on python and no ML and Deep Learning.
This includes a few object detection projects that I made during my (currently ongoing) process of learning Computer Vision. All the current projects are only made using OpenCV on python and no ML and/or Deep Learning is invloved.
